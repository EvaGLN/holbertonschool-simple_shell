## Overview

This project is a basic implementation of a Unix command interpreter.

Our goal was to understand how a shell works internally: reading user input, parsing commands, creating processes, and executing programs using system calls.

## Flowchart

The following flowchart represents the main execution process of our Simple Shell:

The flowchart shows the different stages of the shell:

1. Check whether the shell is running in a terminal.
2. Display the prompt in interactive mode.
3. Read the command using `getline`.
4. Check for `EOF`.
5. Tokenize the command.
6. Check whether the command is a built-in.
7. Handle `exit` or `env` when applicable.
8. Search for the command using `PATH`.
9. Create a child process with `fork()`.
10. Execute the command with `execve()`.
11. The parent waits for the child process.
12. Free allocated memory.
13. Return to the shell prompt.
